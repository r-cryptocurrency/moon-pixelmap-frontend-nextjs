# Moon Pixel Map Frontend (Next.js)

This is the Next.js frontend for the Moon Pixel Map application. It allows users to view the pixel map, connect their wallets, see their owned pixels, and interact with a chat feature.

## Project Status

This project is currently under initial development.

## Tech Stack

*   Next.js (with App Router)
*   TypeScript
*   Tailwind CSS
*   ESLint
*   Reown AppKit + Wagmi + Viem (for wallet connection)
*   Socket.IO (for chat - to be added)

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version specified in `.nvmrc` or latest LTS)
*   npm or yarn

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository (if not already done):**
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository-url>
    cd moon-pixelmap-frontend-nextjs
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file by copying the example (if one exists) or by adding the necessary variables:
    ```env
    # Backend API URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4321
    
    # Get your project ID from https://cloud.reown.com/
    NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    
    # Contract address (must use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for browser access)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PIXEL_MAP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x934095513c1ff89592A4b8490e263da7a6a4CEAc
    
    # Chain ID (42170 = Arbitrum Nova)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=42170
    ```
    
    **Important Notes:**
    - All browser-accessible environment variables MUST use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
    - Do NOT use quotes around values in `.env.local` files
    - Restart the dev server after changing environment variables

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Available Scripts

*   `dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
*   `build`: Builds the app for production.
*   `start`: Starts a production server.
*   `lint`: Lints the codebase.

## Project Structure

*   `src/app/`: Contains the main application pages and layouts (using Next.js App Router).
*   `src/components/`: Reusable UI components:
    - `PixelMapViewer.tsx`: Canvas-based pixel map with pan/zoom and multi-select
    - `UpdatePixelModal.tsx`: Modal for uploading images to single or multiple pixels
    - `PixelMapArea.tsx`: Container managing map interactions and modal state
    - `PixelInfoCard.tsx`: Displays information about selected pixels
    - `ChatDisplay.tsx`, `ChatInput.tsx`: Chat interface (UI only, not connected yet)
*   `src/context/`: React context providers (WalletContext, Web3Provider).
*   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useUserPixels.ts`).
*   `src/services/`: API services and data fetching utilities.
*   `src/config/`: Configuration files (contract ABI, Web3Modal config).
*   `public/`: Static assets.

## Key Features

### Multi-Select Mode
Toggle between **Pan Mode** and **Multi-Select Mode** using the button in the top-left of the pixel map:
- **Pan Mode**: Click and drag to move around the map, scroll to zoom
- **Multi-Select Mode**: Click and drag to select a rectangular area of pixels
  - Visual overlay shows selection size
  - Ownership validation ensures you only update pixels you own
  - Upload one image that gets automatically split across selected pixels
  - "Clear Selection" button to reset

### Pixel Updates
- Single-click a pixel in Pan Mode to open the update modal
- Select multiple pixels in Multi-Select Mode for batch updates
- Upload images (automatically scaled to fit selection)
- Real-time preview before updating
- Transaction handling through connected wallet

## Backend API

This frontend interacts with the `moon-pixelmap-backend-pg` service. Ensure the backend is running and accessible.

*   Pixel Map Image: `[NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL]/api/pixelmap`
*   Pixel Data (JSON): `[NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL]/api/pixels`
*   User Data: `[NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL]/api/users`
*   Pixel Updates: `[NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL]/api/pixels-update`
